# 🖼️ DeepCIFAR-ImageClassifier

This project builds, trains, and improves a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** — a challenging dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes such as airplanes, cars, and birds.

The goal is to start with a baseline CNN and incrementally apply techniques to enhance accuracy and generalization.
